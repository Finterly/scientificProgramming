# Scientific Programming
Course about scientific programming, from algorithm to implementation.

## Course Description

Scientific programming is quite like performing a wetlab experiment: there is a
research question, an experimental design, materials, and results. Of course,
one important difference is once you run your experiment once, repeating the
experiment becomes a lot easier. This course assumes programming experience
and covers various aspects of using scientific programming for development
of software to answer biological questions. During this course the students will
using professional software development standards and values for research
integrity, particularly around reproducibility. Regarding algorithm development,
the course focuses on programming approaches like parallel computing,
client-server communication, and automating statistical analysis using
interactive notebooks.


## Course Objectives

1. Create software to implement an algorithm answering a biological question
2. Learn about parallel computing
3. Learn about server-client interaction
4. Learn about making multivariate statistics reproducible
5. Apply version control in software development
6. Explain algorithms and implementations in software in appropriate
   documentation

## Topics

Week 1 provides a lecture introducing the course, and the practical
is a GitHub 101 (students are free to use GitLab or another alternative).

1. Week 2,3: Server-Client Interaction
2. Week 4,5: Making multivariate statistics reproducible
3. Week 6,7: Parallel computing
